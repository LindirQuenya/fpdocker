# fpdocker
Dockerfiles for use in portable Linux version of the Flashpoint Project.

Build them with `./build.sh`, and run the resulting unity-supporting (ish) container with `./run.sh`.

That should give you a shell. From there, open basilisk (`/basilisk/basilisk`), and try opening a page that requires unity.
