Things that I still need to work on:
 - Older SA projector versions, see https://nexus.fp.unstable.life/#browse/browse:flash-binaries:projectors for a list.
 - Same list as above, but windows versions on wine.
 - Fix Xhost authentication, instead of just disabling it.
 - Fix unity. It's broken right now. This will likely require messing with Wine and Pipelight.
 - Add support for more unity versions.
 - Auto-enable basilisk plugins.
 - (Low-priority) Wine-d versions of flash plugins, maybe through Pipelight? Modification might be needed.
 - (Low-priority) Make all these images work in environments that aren't mine.
